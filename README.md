# Card-Picker

Cardpicker is a hybrid app for both Android and IOS. 

The app was developed for an organization I volunteer at to help call people at random from a waiting room. Each person gets a card, those are entered into the app, and a card is chosen at random.  Prior to this it was a completely manual process consisting of: sorting cards, matching doubles, pulling from a hat.
